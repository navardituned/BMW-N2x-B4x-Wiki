<h1>N2x Common Mods</h1>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Upgraded Intakes:&nbsp;</mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded intakes are beneficial as you go up the "Mod Tree" as they are less prone to heat soak and cracking/damage, allow more air to feed into your turbo, and increase intake sound. It's important to research before purchasing to avoid problematic intakes. Known upgraded intakes that are reliable include Injen Evolution Intake system and Mishimoto Performance Air Intake System.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Upgraded Turbo Inlets:&nbsp;</mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Turbo inlets commonly fail and cause issues with the car stalling or triggering CEL Codes. Upgrading to a solid metal inlet minimizes the amount of connection points and reduces the risk of leaks occurring in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Upgraded Intercoolers:</mark>&nbsp;</h6>
<ul>
  <li>Bigger intercoolers are better, but it's important to ensure it fits your bumper. If you have a "Sport/Luxury" front bumper, opt for a more reasonable 5-5.5 inch intercooler. If you have a "M-Sport" front bumper, go for something around 6-9 inches. Bar and plate construction is preferred for FMIC applications.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Upgraded Charge-Pipes:&nbsp;</mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded charge-pipes are important as the stock system is weak and prone to cracking under high boost and various heat cycles. Consider the design and features and upgrade hose clamps.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Upgraded Diverter Valve/BOV:&nbsp;</mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>The ability to release excess boost pressure is important for the performance of the system under high boost. Upgraded DVs are recommended to prevent breaking due to the plastic construction of the stock unit.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Oil Catch Can:</mark>&nbsp;</h6>
<ul>
  <li>This helps prevent carbon build up in the intake ports which requires a walnut blast to remove and restore engine performance.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue">Spark Plugs:&nbsp;</mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Stock spark plugs (NGK 97506) are the go-to performance plug for the platform. Reducing the gap to around 0.022 inches helps ensure the spark plug doesn't break down and cause a misfire. Upgraded coil packs are an alternative to running a smaller gap. Running smaller gaps reduces the service life of the plug.</li>
</ul>
