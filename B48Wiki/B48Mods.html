<h1>B4x Common Mods</h1>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Upgraded Intakes:</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded intakes become more beneficial as you upgrade your engine setup. The stock intake is prone to cracking due to heat absorption from the engine and radiator fan. Upgraded intakes can use materials that are less prone to heat soak and feed more air into your turbo, as well as providing increased intake sound.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Upgraded Turbo Inlets:</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Turbo inlets are prone to failure due to their plastic designs, and are also an air restriction to upgraded turbos. Upgrade to a solid metal inlet, as it is more robust and minimizes the risk of leaks.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Upgraded Intercoolers For B4x With FMIC (Mini Cooper):</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Upgraded intercoolers reduce overall intake air temperatures. Bigger is usually better, and a bar and plate construction is preferred for FMIC applications.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Upgraded Intercoolers For B4x With Water to Air Intercooler:</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>There are no current upgrades to the intercooler/intake manifold for the B4x water to air intercooling system. The best upgrade options are to add Meth Injection or an upgraded radiator core/heat exchange, which can reduce the intake air temperature by 5 degrees Celsius and help to promote better performance while reducing detonation.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Upgraded Charge-Pipes:</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>Upgrading charge-pipes is important due to the weakness of the stock plastic/silicon charge-pipe system, which is known to crack under high boost and heat cycles. Choose a charge-pipe with meth bungs and upgraded hose clamps.</li>
</ul>
<h6><mark class="marker-blue"><strong>Oil Catch Can:</strong></mark></h6>
<ul>
  <li>This helps prevent carbon build up in the intake ports which requires a walnut blast to remove and restore engine performance.</li>
</ul>
